# Winston Salem, NC Schools
## [Winston Salem School Map](https://fogartycb.github.io/WinstonSalem_Schools/)
-------------
This map is an interactive map showing the schools in Winston Salem, North Carolina, while also showing the population density in the areas the schools are located.  The user can click on the apple icons to see the name of the school and looking at the color of the icon they will also be able to see what level school it is.

The apple icons are considered the point data in this map and each icon represents a different school and shows the area the school is in as well as the name when the icon is clicked.  A choropleth map is used to show the population density in these areas.  This makes it easier for the audience to see if there is a difference in the quantity of schools in more populated areas versus less populated areas.

HTML, Javascript, CSS, and Leaflet were all used to help give this map a basemap, and map elements such as font, color, size, and other commands like assigning different attributes to different data.  Data gathered also had to be converted from shapefiles to GeoJSON using QGIS.
